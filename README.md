# scripts

A collection of scripts I use, some of which work with Raycast (if you add this repository as a "Script Commands" directory from within "Extensions").

Tracking policy:

- This repo uses an allowlist `.gitignore`; only files explicitly un-ignored are tracked
- Add new script extensions to `.gitignore` when introducing them
