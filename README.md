# scripts

A collection of scripts I use, some of which work with Raycast if you add this repository as a "Script Commands" directory from within "Extensions".

Generally I recommend adding this repository to your path, example (to your `~/.zshenv`):
```bash
export DEV=$HOME/Developer
export PATH=$PATH:$DEV/scripts
```
